## Phase 1: User Research

This phase will:

- Assess the current attitudes towards open working practices in the Turing research community, and
- Uncover barriers/fears around open working practices in research.

This will be achieved by:

- Conducting a series of interviews with Turing research staff.

### Milestone 1: Planning

- Create/Collate all the resources required to conduct the interviews

### Milestone 2: Implementation

- Scheduling and completing interviews
- Collating and storing interview transcripts

### Milestone 3: Post-Interview Analysis and Reporting

- Analyse transcripts
- Generate reports
- Report dissemination

This phase will:

- Build on Phase 1 to design the open practices we'd like to promote, whilst
- Explicitly address barriers/fears raised and/or confirmed in Phase 1.

This will be achieved by:

- Completing a behavioural design exercise.

## Phase 3: Processes (TBD)
