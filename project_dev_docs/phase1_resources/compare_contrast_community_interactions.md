## Prompt

### Where am I now?

| What kinds of community interactions exist in my organization’s internal culture and external community? | What kinds of value exchanges go with these interactions? Do I think they are equitable? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Example: _We frequently solicit ideas from people inside the organization about how to improve meetings._ | Example: _We don’t recognize the people whose ideas we use and we don’t explain our decision-making when we do change meeting structures. This doesn’t seem equitable to me._ |
| | |

### Where do I want it to be?

| What kinds of community interactions would I like to have in my organization’s internal culture and external community? | What kind of equitable value exchanges would I like my organization to offer as part of these interactions? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Example: _We should make time during each meeting for a new voice to try something new, like giving thanks or reporting out on a project that’s below most people’s radars. That way we could solicit ideas about our meeting structures and co-create parts of their agendas together._ | Example: _We could recognize these new speakers in the agendas we send out before meetings and make sure that we rotate through all staff and invite everyone to suggest something to try. We could also share some of our decision-making about why we’d like to try their ideas in the same emails. This would help us recognize people who contribute new ideas and share information more openly among staff._ |
