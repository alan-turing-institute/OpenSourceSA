# Interview Script for User Research into Open Practices

**Running time:** 30-45 mins

## Context

_What do we want to find out?_

- Interview different people across different themes and at different levels (for example, researcher, project manager, project lead, and so on)
- Assess the current attitudes towards open working at the Turing
- Uncover barriers and hidden fears towards open working
- Understand what Turing people need to address these concerns, what processes need to be put in place, for example
- Not promoting open working, rather gaining an understanding of the barriers and drivers within the Turing community

## Aims

1. Understand how researchers, theme leaders, project management and research engineers at the Alan Turing Institute define open practices
2. Understand to what extent these groups are already working in line with open practices in their daily roles
3. Understand the main barriers and drivers for adoption of working proactices across the Alan Turing Institute

## Questions

4. From your perspective, what are the key differences between the four terms? [_Answers Aim 1_]
5. What do you view as the main benefits of open working?
6. What do you view as the main drawbacks of open working?
7. To what extent do you consider yourself working openly, in the context of the work you do at the Turing? How would you qualify that? [_Answers Aim 2_]
   1. [_If they don't work openly_] If you don't work openly at all, can you explain in more detail the barriers to working openly in this context?
   2. [_If you require more detail_] Can you explain in more detail how you consider yourself to be working openly?
8. To what extent do you consider open practices to be a part of the workplace culture at the Alan Turing Instite? [_Answers Aim 2_]
9. To what extent do you consider open practices to be **encouraged** at the Alan Turing Institute? [_Answers Aim 3_]
   1. How are they being encouraged?
10. [_If they have not answered the above_] What are the main barriers to adopting open practices at the Alan Turing Institute? [_Answers Aim 3_]
11. In your opinion, what are some practical steps the Institute could take to removing or lowering the barriers to open practices? [_Answers Aim 3_]
12. Are there any examples of open working you have experienced outside the Institute?
    1. [_Probe_] Can you provide more detail?
    2. [_Probe_] What do you think the Institute could learn from these examples?
13. Are there any other comments or input you'd like to offer?
