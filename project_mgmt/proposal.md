# Open Source Service Area for the Turing Institute

## Problem Statement

Presently, there is no formal support mechanism for embedding best practices around open software development available in Research Engineering or the Turing Institute.
This gap impedes a number of pathways to delivering the Turing’s mission statement, such as: the ability to support Turing projects that want to work openly, the Institute’s ability to find and form new collaborations, and a reduction in efficiency since work is often duplicated or reinvented.

Working to either build an open project from the ground up or contributing work to an existing open source project requires a set of skills that include, but are not limited to, technical capability, such as connecting with and participating in a community, or building and managing a community.
By providing a support system for developing and embedding these skills into Turing projects, we can accelerate innovation and research output across the Institute by effectively collaborating across the Turing network, forging new connections, and reducing duplicated effort by building on existing tools.
Overall, positively impacting the Turing’s ability to deliver world-leading data science.

## Proposed Solution

This proposal is for a Turing Service Area in Open Source that will provide formal support in open working and embedding best practices of open software development into Turing projects.
This service area will create an Open Developer Advocate position whose role will be to work with and guide projects into working openly and either build a community around their open project, or make a contribution to an existing open project.
This guidance would take the form of regular meetings, co-working and/or drop-in sessions and would address roadmapping of the project in terms of its open goals, and developing project policies for engaging openly.
It will work very closely with the Turing Way project both to draw on existing material and to contribute new processes to the handbook.

## Deliverables

Over the course of the proposed period, this service area will work with 1-2 Turing projects who wish to work openly.
The Open Developer Advocate will assist the project in roadmapping the development of its community or making it’s contribution and provide guidance around best practices and open community engagement.
The success of this collaboration would be measured by any combination of the following:

- Number of contributions made;
- Number of new contributors onboarded.

In addition to these focus goals and to encourage other projects to consider open working, the service area will also:

- Develop a “Project Spotlight” blog template for introducing and highlighting projects that wish to invite contributors from outside the Turing community;
- Host a “hack week” event to create a template repository for hosting project websites with predefined sections: introduction, installation, interactive tutorials, how to get involved.

| Research Engineering                   | Work with the Community Management team to embed open skills and values within the team through expectation setting and ways of working guidelines. |
| Tools, Practices and Systems programme | Work with projects within this programme to embed open working best practices into and produce open contributions where appropriate. Draw on existing material within the Turing Way and contribute new processes to the handbook. |
| Communications Service Area            | Produce a “Project Spotlight” blog template for promoting Turing projects that are working openly and/or seeking collaboration.                     |
| Training Service Area                  | Provide guidance on open working topics and workflows as training for students and the business team at the Turing.                                 |
