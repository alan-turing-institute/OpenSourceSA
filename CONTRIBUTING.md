# Contributing Guidelines

**_A service area sharing the knowledge and skills to participate in or grow an open project with the Turing research community._**

Hello! Welcome! And thank you for contributing to the Open Source Service Area repository.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Service Area.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules.
Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

**Table of Contents:**

- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
- [Important Resources](#important-resources)

## Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this conduct.
Please read the document carefully and report any unacceptable behaviour to the contact listed within.

## Important Resources

This project's [README](README.md) is a hub to give you some information about what the service area hopes to achieve, where you can find out more, and how you can get involved.

You can find the roadmap outlining the long- and short-term goals of the project in the [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) file.

- **Current project phase:** :one:
- **Current project planning board:** [Phase 1: User Research Roadmap](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/OpenSourceSA/projects/1)

Other project management documentation is generally located in the [`project_mgmt` folder](./project_mgmt) and includes:

- [The project proposal](project_mgmt/proposal.md)
- [The project open canvas](project_mgmt/open_canvas.pdf)
- [Our Ways of Working](WAYS_OF_WORKING.md)
- [Our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Any templates or documentation resources are located in the [`project_dev_docs` folder](./project_dev_docs), which is then broken down by phase according to the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Communication Channels

We strive to work as openly as possible and, therefore, we encourage community members looking to improve the framework or start a collaboration with us to [open an issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/OpenSourceSA/issues/new).

We also participate in more general discussions around open practices in the `#tps` channel (for the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme) on the Alan Turing Institute's Slack workspace.
If you are not a member of this workspace, you will need to be invited by a member of the Turing and approved.

If you need to reach out to a project member directly, please see the [Ways of Working](WAYS_OF_WORKING.md) document that outlines our members' preferred communication methods.

## How to Submit Changes

If you are contributing to the framework we implement in anyway, you will most likely find yourself editing the documents in this GitHub repository.
We follow good [gitflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) practices, outlined below, in order to a maintain clean history and, most importantly, avoid the merge conflict where possible!

1. [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#forking-a-repository) of this repository
2. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch) to work on
3. [Commit your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to the branch
4. [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

At this point, a project member will review your Pull Request and either accept and merge it, or request some further tweaks before merging.
We aim to do this in a timely manner, but please ping us if we haven't reviewed your contribution after 2 weeks.
